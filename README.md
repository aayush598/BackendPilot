## 📌 Problem Statement

Select the problem statement number and title from the official list given in Participant Manual.

**Example:**  
**Problem Statement  – AI Agent for Automated Backend Code Generation
Design an AI-powered agent capable of generating complete backend code based on user-provided inputs. The agent must accept a natural language description of the project, user-specified backend tech stack (initially supporting only Flask), the operating system (Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, or macOS), and the desired folder path for project setup.**

## 🎯 Objective

AI Agent for Automated Backend Code Generation
Design an AI-powered agent capable of generating complete backend code based on user-provided inputs. The agent must accept a natural language description of the project, user-specified backend tech stack (initially supporting only Flask), the operating system (Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, or macOS), and the desired folder path for project setup.

The system should offer two modes of operation:

One-Step Solution – Generates the entire backend project in one go.

Step-by-Step Solution – Builds the project incrementally, allowing the user to review and modify each step.

Once inputs are collected, the agent should:

Generate the folder structure.

Create setup files and generate prompts for code generation using an AI LLM (Qroq).

Create main and test code files, validate them through automated testing and linting.

Handle errors intelligently by re-prompting the LLM up to a user-defined retry limit.

If errors persist, notify the user for manual correction.

Upon successful generation, the agent should:

Comment the code for developer understanding.

Generate detailed backend documentation in PDF format.

Offer download of the full code as a ZIP file.

Optionally upload the code to a GitHub repository and deploy it on Render.

The system must ensure a fully automated, intelligent backend development pipeline with options for customization, error recovery, and deployment readiness.

### Your Approach:  
- We chose this problem because we saw a clear gap in how dynamic, content-rich applications manage and deliver backend content efficiently. Traditional approaches often lead to overfetching data, slow load times, and rigid APIs.
By focusing on GROQ and Sanity CMS, we aimed to create a backend that could deliver exactly the data needed — no more, no less — in a fast, scalable, and developer-friendly way. Solving this problem helps build better user experiences, improves backend performance, and showcases modern best practices in content management and API design. 
- We addressed challenges of efficient data fetching, dynamic content handling, performance optimization, and scalable backend structuring using GROQ and Sanity CMS.  
- During hacking, we pivoted towards using GROQ more deeply for nested data fetching, brainstormed better query optimization strategies, and had a breakthrough in dynamically structuring complex content with minimal backend changes.
