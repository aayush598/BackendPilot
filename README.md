# 🚀 Backend Poilet

> Revolutionizing backend development through AI-powered automation

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
**Problem Statement  – AI Agent for Automated Backend Code Generation
Design an AI-powered agent capable of generating complete backend code based on user-provided inputs. The agent must accept a natural language description of the project, user-specified backend tech stack (initially supporting only Flask), the operating system (Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, or macOS), and the desired folder path for project setup.**

---

## 🎯 Objective

I Agent for Automated Backend Code Generation

The AI agent generates complete backend code based on user inputs, including project description, tech stack (initially Flask), OS (Windows, Linux/Ubuntu, macOS), and folder path. It offers two modes:

One-Step Solution: Generates the entire project at once.

Step-by-Step Solution: Builds the project incrementally for user review and modification.

The agent:

- Creates the folder structure, setup files, and code using AI (Qroq).

- Generates main and test files, validates them with automated testing and linting.

- Handles errors with retries and notifies the user for manual corrections if needed.

- Comments the code, creates detailed documentation in PDF, and offers the code for download as a ZIP.

-Optionally uploads to GitHub and deploys to Render.

The system aims to streamline backend development with intelligent automation, error recovery, and deployment readiness.

### Your Approach:  
- We chose this problem because we saw a clear gap in how dynamic, content-rich applications manage and deliver backend content efficiently. Traditional approaches often lead to overfetching data, slow load times, and rigid APIs.
By focusing on GROQ and Sanity CMS, we aimed to create a backend that could deliver exactly the data needed — no more, no less — in a fast, scalable, and developer-friendly way. Solving this problem helps build better user experiences, improves backend performance, and showcases modern best practices in content management and API design. 
- We addressed challenges of efficient data fetching, dynamic content handling, performance optimization, and scalable backend structuring using GROQ and Sanity CMS.  
- During hacking, we pivoted towards using GROQ more deeply for nested data fetching, brainstormed better query optimization strategies, and had a breakthrough in dynamically structuring complex content with minimal backend changes.
